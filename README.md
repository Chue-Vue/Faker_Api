Faker API
To solidify the concepts of making our own api, we are going to create an api that generates a random user on a GET request. We will be using Postman to make our GET requests.



In this assignment, we will be using 2 javascript libraries to create a simple API that generates a User and/or Company depending on the route:

Express (Server)
Faker (Fake data generator)


Go ahead and follow the checklist below using the 2 classes below:

User class
_id
firstName
lastName
phoneNumber
email
password

Company class
_id
name
address
street
city
state
zipCode
country


Faker
The faker library has a ton of methods we can use to populate specific fields with randomly generated data. Look through the faker documentation and search through the methods to choose the ones that you would use to populate each field.
